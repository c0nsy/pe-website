              With over 25 years in the industry, our owner Troy brings a lifetime of hands-on experience, an unmatched work ethic, and a deep-rooted passion for getting the job done right. What started as a high school hustle quickly grew into a full-fledged career—earning his stripes the hard way and building a name that's now trusted across Cambridge, Kitchener, Waterloo, and throughout Waterloo Region.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Originally established as an incorporated company in 2012, the business continued to evolve—accepting new challenges, scaling operations, and ultimately merging with a well-established local property maintenance enterprise. That strategic move led to the creation of Platinum Enterprise Group, bringing together years of experience, trusted service, and a shared commitment to excellence under one banner. The result? A stronger, more versatile team that delivers consistent results for every client throughout Cambridge, Kitchener, Waterloo, and surrounding communities.
            </p>

              And when winter hits? Our 24/7 weather monitoring and rapid-response snow and ice control programs help keep your site safe, clean, and accessible throughout Waterloo Region. When spring rolls around, we shift gears into full property care mode—trimming, edging, planting, and making sure every inch of your space looks dialed in.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              At Platinum, we take pride in being a step above the rest—backed by experience, driven by results, and always ready to go the extra mile. But make no mistake: it's our clients who make us. We don't see ourselves as a step above them—we see ourselves right beside them, working together to bring their vision to life.
